# To Use With Google Spreadsheet

If you want to use Google Spreadsheet as a datasource you just have to update the 'OKR_Spreadsheet' data source within the explorer and authorize your account. You'll need a Spreadsheet with the same structure as the variable list 'OKR_Values'. Finally you have to select the Tile View on the canvas and change the data source from the dataflow 'Dataflow_OKRs' to 'Dataflow_OKRs_w_Spreadsheet':
