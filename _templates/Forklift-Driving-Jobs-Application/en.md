title: Efficient task management for forklifts
description: 
  - This template was specifically designed for use on a forklift touchscreen and significantly optimizes drivers' workflows. Drivers can conveniently log in to their vehicle and immediately receive a clear list of open driving tasks, which they can select from. The application displays the pickup and destination locations graphically on a map and also provides important information about the task, such as the number of required trips. Particularly useful is the ability to complete tasks with a comment or report issues directly, once finished. New driving jobs can be created via [this](https://templates.peakboard.com/Forklift-Driving-Jobs-Planner/en) application.

  - This leads to more efficient communication and reduces delays in logistics. The application not only simplifies navigation for drivers but also contributes to better coordination and prevents misunderstandings, ultimately benefiting productivity and efficiency in your warehouse or on your company premises.

  - Download the template for free and customize it to meet your internal logistics needs without any coding effort. To make it even easier to use, all scripts in this template were created with Peakboard Building Blocks, our low-code scripting editor.
