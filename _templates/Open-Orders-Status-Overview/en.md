title: Open Orders Status Overview
description: 
  - This visualization shows all open orders in a production. Each order must pass through three work steps&#58; gluing, sawing and welding. A traffic light indicates whether the work step for the respective order has been started, is currently in progress, or has already been completed. With a touch screen the transport orders can be filtered based on the product to be produced. The data is stored in a static list but could be linked to an ERP system such as the transfer orders from SAP (LTAK Table).
