title: Easily display production order status on individual dashboards
description: 
  - "Keep your production orders in sight! With this template you can see the status of open customer orders of your production in a practical overview. In addition to the type of order, you can also see the progress of individual orders. In our example, each order goes through three steps: gluing, sawing and welding. A traffic light automatically shows whether the work step for the respective order has been started, is currently in progress or has already been completed. The production orders can be filtered via a touch screen. The data is stored in a variable list, but can also be linked to an ERP system such as the transport orders from SAP (table LTAK). Download the template for free and customize your very own dashboard!"
