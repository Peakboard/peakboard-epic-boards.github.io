title: Truck Assignment with Peakboard Edge
description: 
- This template offers the possibility to assign different trucks to a certain gate at a certain time. The assignment of the trucks is done via the Peakboard Web Interface. There, you can store and maintain all data directly on the Peakboard Box. If more than 7 gates are specified, the view automatically changes to the next page. Upload the visualization to your Peakboard Box and open the Peakboard Web Interface to manage your gates and trucks. The traffic lights of the visualization are linked to an individual Peakboard Edge. If you link your Peakboard Edges in the edge data source of the visualization, you can display the status directly at the gate using a common signal light.
