  - Retail of electronic components (same-day-delivery)​ 
  - 4 different storages with the same displays 
  - ​Peakboard-Box is calculating the Delta, between the planned and current status ​
overview_benefits:
  - Because of same-day delivery the goods in the ERP system by  2 pm, has to packed and get ready by 4 pm  -> associated with high costs, because it is unpredictable how many people have to be deployed. Helpful to manage workforce.​
