# possible data sources
This template uses Peakboard [variable lists](https://help.peakboard.com/scripting/en-variables.html) as fictitious data sources. In a real scenario you could connect your systems instead. Machine-oriented communication methods could be interesting here, such as: MQTT, OPC UA, Siemens S7, Azure Event & IoT Hub, Werma, Mitsubishi Electric, Beckhoff Automation, Bosch IoT Gateway, Rockwell Automation or MT Connect. There are many data sources you could use for this board, you can find an overview [here](https://peakboard.com/en/interfaces/).
