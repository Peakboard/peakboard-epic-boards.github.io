title: Simple digital call system â€“ overview dashboard
description: 
  - This template is part of a digital call system and provides a comprehensive overview of all workstations and their production status. The dashboard displays the workstations along with the number of parts produced at each one. If a problem is reported at a workstation, it is marked in red, allowing supervisors to intervene immediately. With this overview, you can always keep track of the current production status, quickly identify issues, and take action to optimize efficiency and response times in your manufacturing process.
  - The corresponding application for recording the data can be found [here](https://templates.peakboard.com/Simple-Digital-Call-System-Workplace/en).
