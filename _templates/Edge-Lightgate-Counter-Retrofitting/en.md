# possible data sources

This template uses the Peakboard Edge data source. Peakboard Edge can directly input and output information about external devices. Peakboard Edge does not communicate via a display, but is always connected to a Peakboard Box. [Here you can learn more about Peakboard Edge](https://peakboard.com/produkt/peakboard-edge/). 

How exactly this template works and how you can build it yourself, you can find out in this YouTube Video:
