title: MQTT as data source â€“ your MQTT dashboard with Peakboard
description: 
  - "This visualization shows how to use MQTT as a data source to easily enable communication between two dashboards: The two monitors can be located at completely different locations in the production hall. The worker uses one of the monitors at his station to request maintenance. The production manager in turn sees the message on his monitor in real time and can react accordingly. This shortens reaction times and enables problems to be solved more quickly. Download template now."
