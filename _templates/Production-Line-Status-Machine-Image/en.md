  - Use Case&#58; Can be shown up by an error (SPS), if error is fixed switch back to standard production screen. But it also can be used to visualize the assembly line.
overview_benefits:
  - Operator can identificate exactly where and what kind of error. The result is faster response and better reaction times in case of an error.​
