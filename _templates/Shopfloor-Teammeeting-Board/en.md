title: Your Teamboard for an Efficient Shop Floor Management Meeting
description: 
  - This interactive dashboard helps you to digitize the shop floor meetings of your team and thus optimize your shop floor management processes. In this way, you can always keep track of all the open tasks of your team. With the dashboard, you can create new tasks and assign them to individual team members, adjust existing tasks if they are e.g. in a new processing status and complete or delete tasks. The dashboard is operated using a mouse and keyboard connected to the Peakboard Box. The captured data is stored and persisted in a list in Peakboard Hub, so the collected data can also be used for long-term evaluations of your production.
  - Via a menu on the left side, you can also navigate to further screens, which display any important production key figures for your shopfloor meeting. In the template these screens were exemplary provided with information on the important KPIs in production, such as safety and quality indicators and OEE values.
  - Although professional digital shopfloor management softwares offer many more functions and possibilities than this template, Peakboard gives you the opportunity to quickly customize your shopfloor board to the specific requirements of your team without a major IT effort and prior knowledge. Our consulting team will be happy to support you.

# possible data sources
This template uses a Peakboard Hub list as a central data source. Data that is collected using a mouse and keyboard connected to the Peakboard Box is written to a Peakboard Hub list, which is then read for the data visualization. Alternatively, you can use other databases such as SQL, Oracle or ODBC for this purpose. The names of the team members are also stored in a list in Peakboard Hub. To use this template with your own Peakboard Hub, you can download the table structure of the task list <a href="Tasks.txt" class="inline" download>here</a> and the structure of the team list <a href="Team.txt" class="inline" download>here</a>. Import them into your Peakboard Hub and then adjust the data sources in the template accordingly.
