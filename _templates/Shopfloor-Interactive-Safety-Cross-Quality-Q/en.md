# possible data sources

This dashboard was created with an SQL database. The values are read from SQL and overwritten in the case of a change in the database. This enables the values to be easily read and written directly via the touchscreen. The template can also be used with other data sources and the values entered can be saved in another system. Possible data sources are: MS SQL Server, MS Access, MS Azure SQL, Oracle Database, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and [many more] (https://peakboard.com/datenanbindungen/).
