# Possible Data Sources

This dashboard was created using the [Peakboard Hub](https://peakboard.com/en/product/peakboard-hub/) as a data source. The values are read from a Peakboard Hub list and overwritten in the case of a change on the dashboard. This enables the values to be easily read and written directly via the touchscreen. The template can also be used with other data sources and the values entered can be saved in another system. Possible data sources are: MS SQL Server, MS Access, MS Azure SQL, Oracle Database, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and [many more](https://peakboard.com/en/data-connections/).
