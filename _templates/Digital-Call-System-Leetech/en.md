title: Overview of a production line in cross section â€“ your manufacturing plant dashboard
description: 
 - This template offers an innovative solution for a digital call system in industrial environments in combination with the call system hardware from Lee-Tech. The system enables efficient communication and fast problem solving directly from the workstations. Using a physical pushbutton with four buttons installed at different workstations, employees can send a signal and switch a traffic light to different colors to indicate status. The colors of the traffic light signal different types of problems or conditions that require immediate attention.

- The Peakboard dashboard lists all workstations that currently have a problem. This visual representation makes it possible to centrally monitor the current problem status at the various workstations at a glance and take immediate action. As soon as a problem is reported, the Peakboard application sends a signal to a pager carried by the department manager. These real-time notifications ensure that problems can be quickly identified and resolved, minimizing downtime and increasing efficiency.

- With this template, the buttons and pagers can be easily and flexibly assigned to the respective departments and workstations. This individual configuration ensures that each department is notified in a specific and targeted manner. Communication within the system takes place via MQTT. This ensures a stable and secure connection between the devices and the Peakboard application. Download the template now, customize it to your company and add further Lee-Tech buttons and pagers.
