# possible data sources

This template uses an Excel data source to simulate a connection to a ticket system. In a real scenario, the data would of course be pulled directly from a ticket system via an API. An API is available for almost every common ticket system, we use Zendesk internally but also Jira, Jira Service Desk, Bugzilla, Redmine or others should not be a problem. For this you can use our standard interfaces such as JSON, XML, CSV, OData, REST API. But also with database based systems this would be possible: ODBC, MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and [many more](https://peakboard.com/en/data-connections/).
