# Possible data sources
This template uses a Peakboard Hub list as the central data source. The collected data is written to a Peakboard Hub list, which is then read by the application. Alternatively, other databases such as SQL, Oracle, or ODBC can be used. To use this template with your own Peakboard Hub, you can download the task list table structure <a href="Template_Assembly_Task_List_Steps.csv" class="inline" download> here</a> and download the structure of the completed steps list <a href="Template_Assembly_Task_List_Timestamps.csv" class="inline" download>here</a>. Import these into your Peakboard Hub and then adjust the data sources in the template accordingly.
