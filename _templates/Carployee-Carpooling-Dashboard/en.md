# how it works

The board work with sample data from variable lists. If you want to use real data, you need a [Carployee](https://www.carployee.com/?lang=en) account.
Ask Carployee directly for API access. Now you just need to update one of the JSON data sources and enter the correct URL and your token. Then you have to connect the single tiles and the two charts with the dataflow "timeline_weeks_DF" and "quickstats_DF". And you're already making the successes visible through carpools.
