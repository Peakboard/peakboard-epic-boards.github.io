description: 
- This example shows how the throughput of a bottling plant can be counted with the help of Peakboard Edge. In addition, you can keep an eye on the current status of each line. Data from other systems such as an ERP could also help employees to keep track of the current production. All you need is Peakboard Edge in combination with Peakboard Enterprise and a standard light barrier with a relay output. With this template you can then visualize the resulting data in order to communicate them directly. Download now!

# possible data sources

This template uses the Peakboard Edge data source. Peakboard Edge can directly input and output information about external devices. Peakboard Edge does not communicate via a display, but is always connected to a Peakboard Box. [Here you can learn more about Peakboard Edge](https://peakboard.com/produkt/peakboard-edge/).

As an alternative to Peakboard Edge, the status of the individual filling lines could also be obtained via machine protocols such as MQTT, OPC UA, Siemens S7, Werme, Mitsubishi Electric or via an MES. The following MES, among others, are supported: FASTEC 4 PRO, FORCAM FORCE, DELMIA Apriso MES and [many more](https://peakboard.com/en/product/peakboard-versions/#dataconnections).
