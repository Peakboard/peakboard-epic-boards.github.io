# possible data sources
This template uses OPC UA as the source of the machine data and a SQL database for the order data. For a historical evaluation, the OEE values are stored in a Peakboard Hub list. For your use case, you can of course use your systems, as Peakboard is compatible with countless pre-systems. A detailed list can be found [here](https://peakboard.com/en/interfaces/).
