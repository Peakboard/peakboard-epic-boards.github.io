title: Your sales dashboard â€“ boost sales through transparency
description: 
  - With this template you can compare the sales of different locations of your company and thus create more competition among your sales employees. Through the comprehensible target/actual comparison of the sales of the respective locations, your sales employees can see where they currently stand and where they should stand and thus strengthen their motivation.  A simple Excel spreadsheet containing the daily sales of the three locations serves as the data basis, but a CRM or sales tool could also be connected here. This template is also a perfect example of how you can use data flows to evaluate such data and make it useful for your purposes. Download now and increase your sales!

# possible data sources
This template uses an Excel file as data source. This file could be stored on a network drive or at a cloud service provider (Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, Sharepoint) and kept up to date there. Alternatively, the data could also be obtained from a SQL database, CRM, BI tool or other systems via a REST API. Just use your systems for your use case. Here are a few examples what would be possible: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, MS Azure SQL, MS Access, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, JSON, XML, CSV, REST-API or [many more](https://peakboard.com/en/interfaces/).
