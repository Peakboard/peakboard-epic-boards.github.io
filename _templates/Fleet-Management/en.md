title: Fleet Management Dashboard for real-time information about your fleet
description: 
  - This useful dashboard gives you real-time information about your fleet and makes your fleet management easier! Keep an eye on how many vehicles are available for your drivers and which ones are currently in use or in the workshop. Additionally, this Fleet Management Dashboard shows you when exactly the next appointments for the workshop or customer service are scheduled. Other important key figures such as the costs for fuel, maintenance or insurance as well as the kilometers driven are also presented in a clear manner - in comprehensible diagrams and, of course, in real time.
