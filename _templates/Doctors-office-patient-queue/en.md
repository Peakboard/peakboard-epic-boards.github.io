title: Patient organization in the medical practice
description: 
  - This dashboard was created in the context of the "WirVsVirus"(UsVsVirus)-Hackathon in March 2020 (wirvsvirushackathon.org) organized by the German government and seven social initiatives. A process was developed to not only better organize waiting times for patients, but also best possibly avoid mutual infection by moving the waiting rooms outside.

# The Idea
The idea behind is to install a Peakboard box with a large, standard screen outside the practice, i.e. outdoors. Before the patients enter the practice, they register by phone. The patient is then put on the digital waiting list with the screen telling them their turn and treatment room. There is also the possibility to list numbers instead of patient names to indicate turns. Patients who are already in the virtual queue, but do not yet have an assigned treatment room, see their status from the status light to get prepared.
The entry takes place via a web interface. No internet connection and only minimal infrastructure is required. A WLAN is sufficient for the network, if necessary also via  mobile phone. No special IT knowledge is required for the installation.
