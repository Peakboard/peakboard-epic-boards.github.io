# The Idea
The idea is to hang a peakboard box with a large, standard monitor outdoors. The patients announce their needs by telephone to the reception. With the help of the monitor, the patients are called visually from a distance and are told which treatment room they should go directly to. Patients who are already in the virtual queue but do not yet have an assigned treatment room can see their status using the traffic light and can prepare themselves for being called soon.

The entry is done via a web interface. No internet connection is necessary and only minimal infrastructure is provided. For the network a Wlan is sufficient, if necessary via a mobile phone. The installation can also be done by non-IT personnel without any problems.
