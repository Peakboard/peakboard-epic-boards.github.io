title: Simple digital call system for the industrial workplace
description: 
  - This template provides a simple and efficient digital call system that can be used at industrial workstations via a touchscreen or industrial tablet. With this application, a worker can manually log when a part has been completed and report issues. This ensures that production supervisors are informed immediately and can respond accordingly.

- All recorded information is centrally displayed on a corresponding overview dashboard on the shopfloor. This enables direct communication, fast problem resolution, and improved visibility of the production status, significantly enhancing operational efficiency and response times.

- You can find the corresponding overview dashboard [here](https://templates.peakboard.com/Simple-Digital-Call-System-Overview/en).
