# possible data sources

This template uses the Peakboard Edge data source. Peakboard Edge can directly input and output information about external devices. Peakboard Edge does not communicate via a display, but is always connected to a Peakboard Box. [Here you can learn more about Peakboard Edge](https://peakboard.com/en/product/peakboard-edge/).
