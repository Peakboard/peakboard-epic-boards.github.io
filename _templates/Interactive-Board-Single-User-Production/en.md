title: Interactive Board for Single-User Production
description: 
  - This template is used as an interactive board for single-user production. By using a touch screen at the corresponding workplace, the respective employee can report problems, stop assembly times and at the same time see how many parts are still to be completed for a specific order. This information can be centrally monitored elsewhere to optimize production. You could also use a similar visualization for plant data collection.
