title: OEE Calculator â€“ simplify your efficiency analysis
description: 
- This practical template helps you to calculate the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) of your production. To do this, you can simply enter the planned values such as the planned production time and the planned quantity. On the other hand, the unplanned downtimes, the quantities actually produced and the number of rejected parts are recorded. The template calculates the OEE value based on these entries and provides you with valuable insights into the efficiency of your production processes. This allows you to take quick and targeted measures to increase productivity and minimise downtimes. Download the template, connect your [data sources](https://peakboard.com/en/data-connections/) and have the OEE calculated automatically in real time, without any manual input.
