description: 
  - This extension allows you to connect printers that support the ESC/POS or ZPL protocol. For this purpose, the extension provides two custom lists, one supporting the ESC/POS protocol from EPSON, the other supporting the ZPL from Zebra. POS printers that support either of these protocols can be integrated into a Peakboard application without the need to install a driver.
  - The ESC/POS source also allows to add the POS printer via the USB port using a virtual serial port. To use the the printer directly a printer driver must be installed.
